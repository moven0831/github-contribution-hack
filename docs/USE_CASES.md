# Use Cases for GitHub Contribution Hack

This document provides in-depth examples of different ways to use the GitHub Contribution Hack for various scenarios and requirements.

## Basic Streak Maintenance

For users who simply want to maintain a consistent contribution streak:

### Configuration

```yaml
# config.yml
repositories:
  - yourusername/personal-website
  - yourusername/blog-content

min_commits: 1
max_commits: 2
min_interval: 20  # hours
max_interval: 24  # hours

# Disable advanced features for simplicity
mcp_integration:
  enabled: false
intelligent_patterns:
  enabled: false
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run in background for continuous operation
nohup python main.py > streak_log.txt 2>&1 &
```

### Result

This configuration creates 1-2 commits per day across your repositories, ensuring your GitHub contribution graph stays active with minimal activity.

## Professional Portfolio Enhancement

For developers wanting to showcase more professional-looking contributions:

### Configuration

```yaml
# config.yml
repositories:
  - yourusername/professional-project
  - yourusername/code-samples
  - yourusername/technical-blog

# More substantial contribution pattern
min_commits: 3
max_commits: 7
min_interval: 8   # hours
max_interval: 16  # hours

# Enable advanced content generation
mcp_integration:
  enabled: true
  complexity: "high"
  language_weights:
    python: 0.5
    javascript: 0.3
    markdown: 0.1
    text: 0.1
  repository_analysis: true
  content_quality: "high"
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run with monitoring to track contribution quality
python main.py --monitor
```

### Result

This setup creates more sophisticated contributions throughout the day, generating high-quality code and documentation that appears more authentic and professional.

## Open Source Contribution Simulation

For developers wanting to simulate active open source participation:

### Configuration

```yaml
# config.yml
repositories:
  - yourusername/open-source-project1
  - yourusername/open-source-project2
  - yourusername/project-docs

min_commits: 2
max_commits: 5
min_interval: 6   # hours
max_interval: 18  # hours

# Configure for diverse content types
intelligent_patterns:
  enabled: true
  content_types:
    - documentation
    - code
    - config
    - tests
  time_distribution: poisson

# Split larger changes into multiple commits
split_commits:
  enabled: true
  max_lines_per_commit: 15
  message_prefix: "Update"
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run with web interface for visualization
python main.py --web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

### Result

This configuration creates a pattern that mimics active open source development, with documentation updates, code changes, and test additions across multiple repositories.

## Academic/Research Project Maintenance

For researchers or students maintaining projects:

### Configuration

```yaml
# config.yml
repositories:
  - yourusername/research-project
  - yourusername/thesis-code
  - yourusername/data-analysis

min_commits: 2
max_commits: 4
min_interval: 10  # hours
max_interval: 20  # hours

# Focus on data and research content
mcp_integration:
  enabled: true
  complexity: "medium"
  language_weights:
    python: 0.6    # More Python for data analysis
    markdown: 0.3  # Documentation
    text: 0.1      # Notes
  content_quality: "high"

# Ensure consistent working hours pattern
scheduler:
  working_hours:
    start: 9       # 9 AM
    end: 18        # 6 PM
  weekend_activity: reduced  # Less activity on weekends
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run with notifications for important events
python main.py --notify
```

### Result

This setup produces a contribution pattern focused on research code and documentation, with activity primarily during academic working hours and reduced weekend activity.

## Job Search Enhancement

For job seekers wanting to demonstrate recent coding activity:

### Configuration

```yaml
# config.yml
repositories:
  - yourusername/portfolio-project
  - yourusername/coding-challenges
  - yourusername/skills-demo

# Intensive contribution pattern
min_commits: 5
max_commits: 10
min_interval: 4    # hours
max_interval: 12   # hours

# Focus on showcasing diverse skills
mcp_integration:
  enabled: true
  complexity: "high"
  language_weights:
    python: 0.3
    javascript: 0.3
    typescript: 0.2
    css: 0.1
    html: 0.1
  content_quality: "high"

visualization:
  enabled: true
  heatmap:
    days: 90  # Focus on recent activity
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run with analytics to track improvement
python main.py --analyze
```

### Result

This configuration creates an impressive recent contribution history with diverse language usage, perfect for job seekers wanting to demonstrate active coding.

## Weekend Warrior Pattern

For developers who primarily code on weekends:

### Configuration

```yaml
# config.yml
repositories:
  - yourusername/weekend-project
  - yourusername/hobby-code

min_commits: 8
max_commits: 15
min_interval: 1    # hours
max_interval: 3    # hours

# Only run on weekends
scheduler:
  weekday_activity: false
  weekend_activity: true
  weekend_intensity: high

# Simple content generation
mcp_integration:
  enabled: true
  complexity: "low"
```

### Usage

```bash
# Set up as a scheduled job
# In crontab:
# 0 9 * * 6,0 /path/to/python /path/to/main.py --weekend
```

### Result

This creates a pattern showing intense weekend activity with minimal to no weekday contributions, mimicking a hobby coder or weekend warrior pattern.

## Legacy Project Maintenance

For maintaining legacy projects with infrequent but regular updates:

### Configuration

```yaml
# config.yml
repositories:
  - yourusername/legacy-project
  - yourusername/maintenance-code

min_commits: 1
max_commits: 2
min_interval: 72   # hours (3 days)
max_interval: 168  # hours (7 days)

# Simple maintenance updates
mcp_integration:
  enabled: true
  complexity: "low"
  language_weights:
    python: 0.3
    c: 0.3       # Legacy code often in C
    shell: 0.2
    make: 0.2    # Build files
```

### Usage

```bash
# Set up as a monthly maintenance task
python main.py --maintenance
```

### Result

This creates a pattern of infrequent but regular maintenance commits, typical of legacy project upkeep.

## Daily Reporting/Documentation

For projects requiring daily documentation or reporting:

### Configuration

```yaml
# config.yml
repositories:
  - yourusername/daily-reports
  - yourusername/documentation

min_commits: 1
max_commits: 1
min_interval: 24   # hours
max_interval: 24   # hours

# Focus on documentation formats
mcp_integration:
  enabled: true
  complexity: "medium"
  language_weights:
    markdown: 0.6
    text: 0.2
    csv: 0.1
    json: 0.1
```

### Usage

```bash
# Schedule for daily execution
# In crontab:
# 0 18 * * * /path/to/python /path/to/main.py --report
```

### Result

This creates exactly one commit per day, typically documentation updates, ideal for daily reporting requirements or documentation maintenance.
