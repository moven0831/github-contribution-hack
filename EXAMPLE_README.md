# GitHub Contribution Hack - Example

This example demonstrates a simplified version of the GitHub Contribution Hack system. It's designed to show you how the system works without requiring the full setup.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Git installed and configured
- A GitHub account with a personal access token (with `repo` scope)
- A GitHub repository you own or have write access to

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install PyYAML GitPython python-dotenv requests
```

2. Run the setup to create configuration files:

```bash
python example.py --setup
```

3. Update the configuration:
   - Edit `.env` and add your GitHub personal access token
   - Edit `example_config.yml` and replace `username/example-repo` with your actual GitHub repository

## Making Contributions

To make a single test contribution:

```bash
python example.py --contribute --repo username/your-repo
```

To make a contribution and verify it was successful:

```bash
python example.py --contribute --verify --repo username/your-repo
```

## Verifying Contributions

To check the latest commit in a repository:

```bash
python example.py --verify --repo username/your-repo
```

## Features Demonstrated

This example showcases:

1. Basic repository cloning and updating
2. Random content generation for commits
3. File creation and git operations
4. GitHub API interaction for verification
